===================
- Game Time is now being tracked as well as Real Time all the time. Components can provide the Game Time. You can switch between Game Time and Real Time in Compare Against.
- Auto Splitters are automatically being suggested in the Run Editor if they are available for a specific game. If activated, they automatically get downloaded and don't need to be part of the layout.
- The Video Component allows you to show a PB or WR video that is synced up to the current run time.
- The Delta Component displays the current delta to a comparison, which is useful for races and comparisons like "World Record" where it shows how far you're ahead or behind without having to use a splits component.
- The Manual Game Time Component allows inserting the Game Time manually as segment times or split times for console games like Sonic where Game Time is used instead of Real Time.
- The Sound Effects Component allows customizable sound effects to be played in certain situations.
- Some of the optional components on the website are now part of the standard LiveSplit (Hotkey Indicator and Current Comparison).
- Components are now categorized to allow for more components without them being a mess.
- Information Components now show shorter information names instead of cutting them off which allows for thinner layouts.
- A new Hotkey API is being used, which should remove some bugs that removed the Hotkeys in LiveSplit 1.3.
- A "Simple Sum of Best Mode" is now available which improves the performance for the Sum of Best calculation, but also might make it less accurate. This is useful for slow PCs or splits with a large segment history.
- The default layout was updated to include all of the new features that have been added since LiveSplit 1.0.
- Information Components now use shorter names if there's not enough space instead of cutting their names off.
- SpeedRunsLive Racing is working again and a lot of issues have been fixed.
- Layouts automatically get placed on the screen if a layout that's outside of the screen gets opened.
- The overall performance in LiveSplit has been improved.

- The Splits Component now features a new coloring option: Alternating colors.
